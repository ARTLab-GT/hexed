/*! \page benchmarking Performance Benchmarking
This page provides visualizations of some of the data in `benchmark.txt`,
which consists of performance benchmarks for selected example cases.
To add another data point, simply navigate to the build directory and run `python3 benchmark.py`.
This will append to `benchmark.txt` which is tracked by git.
Commit the changes if you want your benchmark to be permanently recorded; discard otherwise.

\section overall Overall performance
The following figure illustrates the evolution of Hexed's performance over time, accross different systems.
Different series in the scatter plots indicate different machines on which the benchmarks were run.

\section breakdown Kernel performance breakdown
The following figures offer a more detailed breakdown of the latest benchmark on the machine ae-artl-408091.
When the components don't add up to 100%, that indicates there are some subtasks whose execution time is not measured.
