In this code, a "kernel" refers to a piece of performance-critical code implemented separately
from the rest of the program. Any files titled "benchmark.hpp" contain contrived kernels used
purely for comparison to the real kernels during performance benchmarking. Yes, that code is
terrible. However, that doesn't necessarily matter.
